[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/squidrye/node-relay-api)

this project was created as an intermediate relay api for integrating cashfree payments api in flutter application, payments on android work over token authentications generated over secret keys, these keys are not to be used directly on frontend code and thus this api was created, the api is deployed on glitch.

glitch allows for editing and customization of api by importing this repository(Try clicking the remix button above)

you can change api end points as well as customize .env file with your own private keys.
